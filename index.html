        <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="25" data-line-end="26">With the exception of a dip in 2008, the
            overall trend indicates a steady rise in the total number of claims filed, the total credit amount claimed,
            and the total average credit, from 727,814 claims and $64,737 total credit amount claimed in 2004 to 916,857
            claims and $103,266 total credit amount claimed in 2014, with the total average credit increasing from 89 in
            2004 to 113 in 2014. The dip observed in 2008 may be attributed to the global financial crisis that occurred
            during that time. The crisis had a profound impact on both individuals and families, as well as the economy
            at large.</li>
        <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="26" data-line-end="31">The report includes a slicer located in the
            top right corner that enables users to select a year of interest. Once selected, the top three charts will
            update accordingly to provide insight into the relationship between income level brackets and earned income
            tax credit (EITC) claim data.
            <ul>
                <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="27" data-line-end="28">The first chart, positioned on the
                    left, displays the total number of claims versus income level brackets, with the $4,001-$8,000 and
                    $8,001-$12,000 brackets generally showing the highest number of claims overall. One possible reason
                    that these income level brackets generally show the highest number of claims overall is that these
                    income levels may be the most common among eligible taxpayers in the population. Additionally, the
                    Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) is designed to provide assistance to low-to-moderate income working
                    individuals and families, and those falling into these income level brackets may be more likely to
                    qualify for the credit.</li>
                <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="28" data-line-end="29">The second chart, located in the
                    center, showcases the total credit amount claimed versus income level bracket, with the
                    $8,001-$12,000 and $12,001-$16,000 brackets generally displaying the highest total credit amount
                    claimed. Similar to the first chart, these brackets are in the low-to-moderate income range where
                    many individuals and families qualify for the earned income tax credit (EITC).</li>
                <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="29" data-line-end="31">Lastly, the third chart positioned on
                    the right illustrates the total average credit versus income level bracket, with the $12,001-$16,000
                    and $16,001-$20,000 brackets typically having the highest average credit. One possible reason is
                    that households within these income ranges may have higher numbers of qualifying dependents or may
                    have incurred higher expenses related to dependent care or work-related expenses, which can increase
                    the credit amount. Additionally, households in these income ranges may be more likely to have access
                    to tax preparation services that can help them maximize their credit eligibility.</li>
